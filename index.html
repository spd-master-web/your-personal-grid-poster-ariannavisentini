      <p class="description">Making a description of myself is perhaps the most difficult thing I can do. Doing a self-analysis has always been a big deal for me. Maybe because I see myself as different from what I really am, or maybe because I have an image of myself that doesn't really reflect what others see on the outside.</p>
      <p class="description">I'll start by introducing myself. I'm 25 years old and I was born in Milan from "Milanese d.o.c" parents. I have a 29 architect brother and i live with my cat, her name is Penelope. My artistic vein was born when I was a child, everything that passed through my hands I would transform, paint, decorate and modify. I attended the Brera art school, where I began to give a little more solid basis to this creative aspect of myself. </p>
      <p class="description"> in 2018 I graduated from the Brera academy in artistic design for agency, in the second year a course in web design particularly impressed me, but confused after the three-year course I decided to start working as an intern at Versace Home. I have a first taste of what it means to enter the world of work, the dedication, the rhythms, the commitment. But I wasn't satisfied.</p>
      <p class="description">I wouldn't want to spend so many hours of my time doing a job I don't like and that doesn't satisfy me. I started looking online for web design courses and I came across this master. Here I am, time has flown by and it's already been 8 months. I am very happy and enthusiast, It was one of the best choices I could have made!</p>
